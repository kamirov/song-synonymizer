== Get ultima ==
- Given term, break into characters
- For each character, starting at last character:
    - If character is a vowel:
        - Prepend to ultima
        - Set encounteredVowel to true
    - If character is a consonant, check if encounteredVowel:
        - If encounteredVowel, exit
        - If not encounteredVowel, prepend to ultima


== Adding terms ==
- Given n terms
- For each term as term:
  - Check if term exists in DB
    - If yes, skip term
    - If no:
      - Do E query
      - Do S query
      - Get word ultima
      - Add term to DB
      - For each term from S query as sWord
        - Check if term exists in DB
        - If yes:
          - Add synonym relationship
        - If no:
          - Do E query
          - Add term to DB
          - Add synonym relationship


== Synonymizing==
- Split paragraph into lines
- For each line:
    - For each word:
        - If is pronoun and !preservePronouns, skip word
        - If is article and !preserveArticles, skip word
        - Get synonyms (if preserveWordSyllableCount, only get syns with same syl count)
        - If preserveLineRhyme and word is last word in line:
            - Replace with first synonym with same ultima (if exists)
        - Else:
            - Replace with first synonym (if preserveWordRhyme, get first syn with same ultima). If no syn matches, do nothing

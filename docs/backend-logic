== Get ultima ==
- Given term, break into characters
- For each character, starting at last character:
    - If character is a vowel:
        - Prepend to ultima
        - Set encounteredVowel to true
    - If character is a consonant, check if encounteredVowel:
        - If encounteredVowel, exit
        - If not encounteredVowel, prepend to ultima


== Adding terms ==
- Given n terms
- For each term as term:
  - Check if term exists in DB
    - If yes, skip term
    - If no:
      - Do E query
      - Do S query
      - Get word ultima
      - Add term to DB
      - For each term from S query as sWord
        - Check if term exists in DB
        - If yes:
          - Add synonym relationship
        - If no:
          - Do E query
          - Add term to DB
          - Add synonym relationship


== Synonymizing ==
- Split paragraph into lines
- For each line:
    - If preserveLineSyllableCount:
        - Check if any original words have an unknown number of syllables:
            - For each word, if syllablesCount = null, then skip the line entirely (we can't preserve the original number of line syllables if we don't know it)
    - For each word:
        - Set isPlural for the word, then singularize word
        - Generate a list of replacements:
            - If is pronoun/article/conjunction and preserve<wordClass> is true:
                - Replacement is only the word itself
            - Else:
                - Get synonyms:
                    - If preserveWordSyllableCount, only get synonyms with same syllable count (and only if original word has a known syl count)
                    - If preserveLineSyllableCount, only get synonyms with a valid syl count
                    - If preserveWordRhyme, only get synonyms with same ultima
                    - If preserveLineRhyme and word is last word in line, only get synonyms with same ultima
                - If synonyms exist:
                    - Populate replacements with synonyms for each word
                - Else:
                    - Replacement is only the word itself
    - If preserveLineSyllableCount:
        - Get lineSylCount (add up original syl counts)
        - Generate valid synonym groupings:
            - Iterate through all possible combinations of syllables
            - If the lineSylCount of a combination is = to the original lineSylCount, store the combination
        - Select a random synonym grouping
    - Else:
        - For each word:
            - Replace word with random replacement
            - If isPlural set for the word, pluralize replacement


Flags
    - preserveWordSyllableCount
        - If true, will make sure same number of syllables in each term
        - Very restrictive

    - preserveLineSyllableCount
        - If true, will make sure same number of syllables in each line
        - Need a separate write up for this
        - If preserveWordSyllableCount, then this is disabled (true by default)

    - preserveWordRhyme
        - If true, will synonymize every term with one with the same ultima

    - preserveLineRhyme
        - If true, final term will only be replaced by one with the same ultima

    - preservePronouns
        - If true, won't synonymize pronouns

    - preserveArticles
        - If true, won't synonymize articles
